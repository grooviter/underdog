== Technical Analysis (TA)

The technical analysis module is a wrapper over the link:https://ta4j.github.io/ta4j-wiki/[ta4j] java library. It adds some extension modules to the existent classes so that it makes easier to play with technical indicators and rules and **integrate with Underdog's dataframes and series**.
