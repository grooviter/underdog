You can ask the tree for different attributes such as the degrees:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sources}/IntrospectionSpec.groovy[tag=max_degree, indent=0]
----

Imagine a more complex example where our nodes are beans. In the following example we are repeating the graph but with people:

[source, groovy]
.Person
----
include::{sources}/IntrospectionSpec.groovy[tag=person, indent=0]
----

We create the graph:

[source, groovy]
.Graph using complex objects
----
include::{sources}/IntrospectionSpec.groovy[tag=person_graph, indent=0]
----

Then look for the person with more relationship and extract that person name and age:

[source, groovy]
.Person with more relationships
----
include::{sources}/IntrospectionSpec.groovy[tag=person_max_degree, indent=0]
