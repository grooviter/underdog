=== Operators
:sources: ../../../../../../modules/underdog-graphs/src/test/groovy/com/github/grooviter/underdog/graphs/guide

You can apply arithmetic operations over graphs. Here for example you can apply a union operation over two graphs using the `+` operator:

[source, groovy]
.merging graphs
----
include::{sources}/OperatorsSpec.groovy[tag=operators_plus, indent=0]
----

You can check how the result has all the vertices from the previous merged graphs:

[source, groovy]
.output
----
include::{sources}/OperatorsSpec.groovy[tag=operators_plus_result, indent=0]
