=== Traversal
:sources: ../../../../../../modules/underdog-graphs/src/test/groovy/com/github/grooviter/underdog/graphs/guide

To traverse the grpah you can directly access the vertices or edges sets and use normal Groovy/Java mechanisms. In the following example we are looking in all vertices to find all vertices having the number two as a neighbor

[source, groovy]
.collections (vertices)
----
include::{sources}/TraversalSpec.groovy[tag=collections_vertices, indent=0]
----

[source, shell]
.output
----
1
----

Now in the next example we are exploring boss-employee relationships and we'd like to find all the bosses names:

[source, groovy]
.collections (edges)
----
include::{sources}/TraversalSpec.groovy[tag=collections_edges, indent=0]
----

Sometimes the graph could be bigger and more complex and we could benefit from using breadthFirst (\*) or depthFirst (**) algorithms:

[source, groovy]
.depthFirst
----
include::{sources}/TraversalSpec.groovy[tag=depth_first, indent=0]
