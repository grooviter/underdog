==== Creation
:sources: ../../../../../src/test/groovy/underdog/guide/dataframe/series

Series are meant to be created from collections or as a transformation from another Series.

The only way to create a **Series** from a collection is invoking the extension method `toSeries()` from a list:

[source, groovy]
.collection extension
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=series_from_collection,indent=0]
----

Most of the time we will be dealing with a Series creation inside the scope of a Dataframe. Sometimes as the result of the transformation of another series, sometimes because we would like to fill a series from a constant value.

Lets say we have a DataFrame with some Series:

[source, groovy]
.sample dataframe
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=series_as_transformation_sample,indent=0]
----

[source, groovy]
.output
----
  numbers
 numbers  |
-----------
       1  |
       2  |
       3  |
       4  |
       5  |
       6  |
       7  |
       8  |
       9  |
      10  |
----

And we want to create a new series named **by_two** with the result of multiplying all numbers in the **numbers** series:

[source, groovy]
.new series
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=series_as_transformation_creation,indent=0]
----

[source, groovy]
.output
----
       numbers
 numbers  |  by_two  |
----------------------
       1  |       2  |
       2  |       4  |
       3  |       6  |
       4  |       8  |
       5  |      10  |
       6  |      12  |
       7  |      14  |
       8  |      16  |
       9  |      18  |
      10  |      20  |

You can also create a new Series inside a dataframe filling all rows with the same value:

[source, groovy]
.series from value
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=series_from_value_creation,indent=0]
----

[source, groovy]
.output
----
           numbers
 numbers  |  by_two  |  one  |
------------------------------
       1  |       2  |    1  |
       2  |       4  |    1  |
       3  |       6  |    1  |
       4  |       8  |    1  |
       5  |      10  |    1  |
       6  |      12  |    1  |
       7  |      14  |    1  |
       8  |      16  |    1  |
       9  |      18  |    1  |
      10  |      20  |    1  |
