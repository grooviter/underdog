A **Series** object represents a named one-dimensional array. It also supports operations and statistical methods. It also has operations to deal with missing values. You can create a **Series** object from different sources:

[source, groovy]
.create
----
include::{sources}/IntroSpec.groovy[tag=create_series,indent=0]
----

<1> from a range of numbers
<2> from a range of letters
<3> from a list

You can use operator symbols to apply simple operations over the Series object:

[source, groovy]
.operations
----
include::{sources}/IntroSpec.groovy[tag=operations,indent=0]
----

<1> multiplying a series by a number
<2> multiplying a series by another series
<3> transforming a series into another series

Sometimes you may want to analyze a given Series object by using statistical methods:

[source, groovy]
.statistics
----
include::{sources}/IntroSpec.groovy[tag=statistics,indent=0]
----

You can find all statistical available methods in the `SeriesStatsExtensions` class.
