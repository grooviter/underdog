==== Creation
:sources: ../../../../../src/test/groovy/underdog/guide/dataframe/dataframe

The easiest way to create a Dataframe is using the Underdog extension method `Underdog.df()`. Here we're creating an empty DataFrame:

[source, groovy]
.empty dataframe
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=empty,indent=0]
----

We can create a dataframe with a series of map entries representing series. In this case the key entry is the name of the series and the value is a collection which will become the content of the series.

[source, groovy]
.dataframe from a map
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=from_map,indent=0]
----

[source, shell]
.output
----
  people-dataframe
  name   |  age  |
------------------
   John  |   22  |
  Laura  |   34  |
 Ursula  |   83  |
----

Underdog dataframe library adds additional methods to collection types so that you can convert from collections to Dataframes. And example is invoking the `toDataFrame(...)` method from the map directly:

[source, groovy]
.map extension
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=map_extension,indent=0]
----

You can also pass a list of maps to the `Underdog.df().from(col, name)` method:

[source, groovy]
.collection of maps
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=collectionsOfMaps,indent=0]
----

[source, groovy]
.output
----
 people-dataframe
  name   |  age  |
------------------
   John  |   22  |
  Laura  |   34  |
 Ursula  |   83  |
----

Here there is also an extension method for collections so that, **IF** your list complies to this structure you can call to the method `toDataFrame(name)` and create a DataFrame from that collection.

[source, groovy]
.collection extension
----
include::{sources}/CreationSpec.groovy[tag=collectionsOfMaps_extension,indent=0]
